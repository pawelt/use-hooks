#  3/6  What they replace

- state class components
    - `useState()` for simple cases
    - `useReducer()` for redux-like semantics and complex state

- side effects (AJAX, timers, events etc.) in lifecycle methods
    - `useEffect()` replaces the following
    - `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()` and `componentWillUnmount()`
    - but you shouldn't think about it in terms of old lifecycle methods
    - just *run this after the component is rendered*
    - optionally: *only if these props changed*
    - optionalluy: *run this after component is unmounted*

- binding event handlers to `this` in `constructor()`
    - `useCallback()`

- caching expensive calculation results as `this` fields
    - `useMemo()` or `useRef()`

- consuming context data with `<Context.Consumer>` render prop
    - `useContext()`

- perf optimisation in `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    - `React.memo()`

- there are a few other hooks and many weird corner cases

- but this covers 99% of typical situations
