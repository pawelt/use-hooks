#  1/6  Why use React hooks

- a new way to "hook into" React features
    - stable since 16.8, usable since 16.7

- allow *reusing stateful logic without changing component hierarchy*
    - custom hooks FTW!

- replace patterns such as HOC and render props
    - fewer wrappers wrapping wrappers
    - easier to follow than nested render props
    - easier to share encapsulated features between projects / developers

- arguably provide more concise, nicer syntax

- practically remove the need for classes, when combined with `React.memo()`

- but classes are NOT deprecated
    - you can use classes and hooks in the same codebase
    - but you CANNOT put hooks inside classes!
