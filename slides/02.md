#  2/6  How they work

- the main concept is simple
    1. when component is rendered, hooks are executed
    2. results are pushed to an array specific to the calling component
        - that's why you shouldn't put hooks in loops, conditions etc.
        - the order has to be same every time
    3. results from previous render call are available in the next render cycle

- implementation details vary for different types of hooks, but the core idea is the same

- it's based on react global state

- but so are class components
    - state from class components and useState() hook is handled the same way internally
    - 99% sure, couldn't find a reference
